## üéØ Learning Objectives

This project was undertaken to solidify my understanding and practical skills in the following areas:

  * **CNN Architecture:** Gaining a deep understanding of core components like `Conv2D`, `MaxPooling2D`, `Flatten`, and `Dense` layers.
  * **TensorFlow/Keras Implementation:** Building a neural network from scratch using a leading industry framework.
  * **Image Data Preprocessing:** Mastering essential techniques for preparing image data for a classification task, including normalization and reshaping.
  * **Model Evaluation:** Analyzing model performance through various metrics to determine its effectiveness.

-----

## üìä Dataset Information

The project utilizes the **MNIST dataset**, a cornerstone for learning computer vision.

  * **Content:** It consists of 70,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0 through 9).
  * **Training Set:** 60,000 images.
  * **Test Set:** 10,000 images.
  * **Image Dimensions:** Each image is a 28x28 pixel grid.

-----

## üß† Methodology

The project follows a systematic machine learning workflow:

1.  **Import Libraries:** Essential libraries like TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, and Matplotlib were imported.
2.  **Load and Preprocess Data:**
      * The MNIST dataset was loaded directly via `tf.keras.datasets.mnist.load_data()`.
      * **Normalization:** Pixel values were scaled from the original `0-255` range to `0-1` to help the model converge faster.
      * **Reshaping:** A channel dimension was added to the images, changing their shape from `(28, 28)` to `(28, 28, 1)`, which is the required input format for the CNN.
      * **One-Hot Encoding:** The target labels were converted into a categorical format.
3.  **Build CNN Model:** The neural network was constructed layer-by-layer using the Keras Sequential API.
4.  **Compile the Model:** The model was compiled with the `Adam` optimizer, `categorical_crossentropy` loss function, and `accuracy` as the evaluation metric.
5.  **Train the Model:** The CNN was trained on the preprocessed training data for 20 epochs with a batch size of 128.
6.  **Evaluate Performance:** The trained model was evaluated on the unseen test data to measure its real-world performance.

| `MaxPooling2D`| 2x2 pool size | (None, 14, 14, 32) |
| `Conv2D` | 64 filters, 3x3 kernel, ReLU | (None, 12, 12, 64) |
| `MaxPooling2D`| 2x2 pool size | (None, 6, 6, 64) |
| `Conv2D` | 64 filters, 3x3 kernel, ReLU | (None, 4, 4, 64) |
| `Flatten` | - | (None, 1024) |
| `Dense` | 64 units, ReLU | (None, 64) |
| `Dense` | 10 units, Softmax | (None, 10) |
