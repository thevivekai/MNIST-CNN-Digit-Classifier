# Documentation for CNN for MNIST Digit Recognition

This document provides a brief overview of the project and its implementation.

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using TensorFlow and Keras to classify handwritten digits from the well-known MNIST dataset. The goal is to achieve high accuracy in digit recognition.

## Implementation Details

The project is implemented in the Jupyter Notebook: `P1_CNN_MNIST.ipynb`.

The notebook is structured as follows:

1.  **Data Loading and Preprocessing:** The MNIST dataset is loaded, and the images are preprocessed for the model.
2.  **Model Building:** A sequential CNN model is defined with convolutional, pooling, and dense layers.
3.  **Model Compilation:** The model is compiled with an optimizer, loss function, and evaluation metrics.
4.  **Model Training:** The model is trained on the training data.
5.  **Model Evaluation:** The trained model is evaluated on the test data to assess its performance.
6.  **Visualization:** The training history and confusion matrix are plotted to visualize the model's performance.

## How to Use

To run the project, open the `P1_CNN_MNIST.ipynb` notebook in a Jupyter environment and execute the cells sequentially.
